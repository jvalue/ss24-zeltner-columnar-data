# Language server Web Worker

Instantiates a Jayvee language server that is meant to run in a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API). It can be used together with the 
[monaco editor](../../libs/monaco-editor) to edit Jayvee files in a browser. Have a look at the [documentation](../../libs/monaco-editor/README.md) of the monaco editor for 
details on how to set them up together.
